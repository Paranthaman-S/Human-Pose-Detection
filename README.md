# Human-Pose-Detection

Detecting the human postures of face, whether sleeping and yawning postures.

## Explanation

- Implemented an innovative Human Pose Detection system for enhancing classroom engagement and safety. Utilized computer vision techniques and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to detect drowsiness among students.

- Drowsiness Detection: Trained a CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow to analyze eye and yawn images, predicting instances of drowsiness accurately.

- Image Pre-processing: Employed OpenCV for robust pre-processing of images, ensuring precise and efficient analysis of facial features.

- Real-time Monitoring: Developed a system capable of real-time monitoring to predict eye status and yawning behavior, contributing to a safer and more interactive learning environment.

- This project showcases my expertise in computer vision, CNN models, and image processing, along with a practical application in ensuring attentiveness within an educational setting.
